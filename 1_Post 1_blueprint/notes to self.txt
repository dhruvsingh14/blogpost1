this needn't be fancy in any way

forget about what metrics people are saying to track 

because it is topical it is more likely to get hits

remember- more content, +targetting ->more hits.

so -- focus on the metrics that interest you

this can be as simple as a trends - linear trends analysis 

- absolute and relative numbers etc.

- peppered with some analysis - that basically confirms what the news says. 

- but, don't paint it so. 


- more specifically. 

I plan to include gdp as part of my analysis. and to make this part of a short - medium post. 

Once this is addressed and out the way - we can start looking at more historic timelines. 

i rather like the us - india comparison thread approach you've taken here.
